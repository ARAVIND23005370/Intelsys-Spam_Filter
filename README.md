# SPAM FILTER:
## Project Overview:
Spams are everywhere in the world. As fast as the Technology develops, Spammers find for Loopholes and exploit the Technology. 
This project mainly focuses on filtering the Spams in various platforms in this world of Technology.
## Main Idea:
The Main Idea of our project is to make it as a versatile platform to filter out the Spam in various platforms like Instagram, Gmail, Reddit and more...
## Project Workflow:
### FIRST STEP:
To build a ML model using Naive Bayes to implement Spam/Ham detection in email texts.
#### Purpose of this..
Building a ML model for filtering out the Spam emails helps you build a Basic knowledge on how a ML model works, how it is trained and how it predicts the answers.
This basic knowledge is important for us to move through the other Advanced Models and Platforms.
#### Why Naive Bayes?
Naive Bayes ML model is very efficient in Filtering out the messages as Spam/Ham and it is way easier to implement.

#### How it works?ðŸ‘‡
For example, let us consider the text, "Win a free iPhone"
The Naive Bayes classifier, checks each word's probability of it in spam or ham in the DataSet. Finally, it multiplies all the words probabilities to find the total probability of the sentence for SPAM and HAM respectively. If the Spam probability is high, then it is classified as a Spam email and vice versa...

#### A short guide to develop the Naive Bayes ML model for Spam detection:
[1] Letâ€™s start by using the NaÃ¯ve Bayes ML model â€“ due to its efficiency and easier implementation.
[2] Get a sample Data-Set for (Spam/Ham) emails - It will be available in the following link;
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets> We can search for spam emails dataset here. A Sample Dataset is shared in WhatsApp group too.
[3] Load the dataset and train the model.
[4] Check for its accuracy
[5] Print the Accuracy score, Confusion Matrix and Classification report.
[6] Then, provide any spam/ham email text as input to the model to check its functioning.
[7] Finally, create a simple User Interface - We Can use Streamlit, (HTML & CSS), Gradio and there are more to explore. In this, Tools like Streamlit and Gradio are in-built python Frameworks to develop Front-end.
[8] After all, We can try other ML models like SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and moreâ€¦ to build the email classification model.
